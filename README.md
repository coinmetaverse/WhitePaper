# OgreCoin WhitePaper

**OgreCoin is a Web3 lifestyle app with inbuilt Game-Fi and Social-Fi elements**

**OgreCoin** is built around an essential daily activity for most people – moving around. We are the first project to effectively bring to life a functioning **move2earn** concept, finishing 4th out of 100+ projects at the BSC Ignition Hackathon 2022.

Users equip themselves with NFTs in the form of Sneakers. By walking, jogging, or running outdoors, users will earn game currency, which can either be used in-game, or cashed out for profit.

With Game-Fi, **OgreCoin** aims to nudge millions toward a healthier lifestyle, combat climate change and connect the public to Web 3.0, all while simultaneously hinging on it’s Social-Fi aspect to build a long-lasting platform fostering user generated Web 3.0 content.
