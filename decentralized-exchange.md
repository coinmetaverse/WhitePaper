# Decentralized Exchange

**Stage 1** : A OgreCoin in-app swap without an independent front end: the swap only serve users within the OgreCoin app (BSC only)

**Stage 2** : A DEX with a front end: anyone can provide liquidity to OGC/USDT pairs.

**Stage 3** : A DEX with a front end: anyone can create liquidity pools for other tokens .

The swap within OgreCoin will charge 1% trading fee. In this 1% fee: 

1. 0.3% will be rewarded to the liquidity providers.

3. 0.1% will be used for the future development work.
