# HP System

***

### Overview

HP stands for Health Points, Freshly minted Sneaker has 100% HP, HP of a Sneaker decays as users spent Energy and use this Sneaker to move. HP of a Sneaker does not decay if users only use this Sneaker to provide Energy. 

The Sneaker HP decay rate* is affected by:

1. Comfort value (Base Comfort, added Comfort via leveling or Gems), the higher the Comfort value, the slower the HP reduction.
2. Sneaker quality, the higher the Sneaker quality, the slower the HP reduction.
3. The amount of the Energy used is proportional to the HP reduction.

* After a Sneaker is minted, HP will not decay for the first 48 hours.
