### Solo Mode Earning Cap

Solo Mode has both a **Daily Energy Cap** and **Daily Token Cap**. These limits restrict the amount of Energy and tokens that users can have per day.

#### **Daily Energy Cap**

Users start the game with 3/3 Energy. Max Energy Caps at 40/40. Users can increase their Energy by getting more or higher quality Sneakers (Refer to Energy System above)

#### **Daily Token Cap**

Users start the game with a 6/6 Daily OGC Cap. The Daily Token Cap maxes out at 600 OGC. Users can increase their Daily Token Cap by leveling up their Sneakers. User can further permanently increase the OGC cap beyond 600/600 by by burning some OGC. This option will only become visible when you reach 90% of your current Daily Cap.
