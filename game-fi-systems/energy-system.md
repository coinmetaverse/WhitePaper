### Energy System

Energy replenishes 25% every 4 hours until it reaches to the Energy Cap. Users start with one Sneaker and 2 Energy Caps. Users can increase their max. Energy by holding more Sneakers. The calculation is as follows:

| **Sneaker No.** | **Energy** | **Move\&earn time (min)** | **Note**     |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1               | 2          | 10                        | Newbie       |
| 3               | 4          | 20                        | Daily User   |
| 9               | 9          | 45                        | Savvied User |
| 15              | 12         | 60                        | Pro User     |
| 30              | 20         | 100                       | Athlete      |

Additional Energy (cumulative) is given to users for higher Quality Sneakers:

1. Owning an Uncommon Sneaker: +1 Energy
2. Owning a Rare Sneaker: +2 Energy
3. Owning an Epic Sneaker: +3 Energy
4. Owning a Legendary Sneaker: +4 Energy

**EXAMPLE 1:**

1 Uncommon Sneaker + 1 Common Sneaker = 3 Total Energy (2 Base Energy + 1 Bonus)

**EXAMPLE 2:**

2 Rare Sneaker + 1 Common Sneaker = 8 Total Energy (4 Base Energy + 4 Bonus)

Listing Sneaker on the Marketplace will result Energy and Energy Cap loss. Transferring Sneaker from one account to another account will result the Sneaker enters a Cooldown period, during Cooldown period, users cannot use this Sneaker.

### Energy Bridge
Energy will not be shared across the realms. This means users will enjoy independent energy from each realm. Starting from the 3rd realm, Users can share energy across different realms, following is the rule of Energy Bridge:

1. Each new realm introduced will allow a maximum of 3 energy to be gained through other existing realms.
2. Each existing realm that you own a sneaker in, will provide 1 additional energy in the new realm.
3. The additional energy gained in the new realm will be capped at 3 in the first month, will decrease to 2 in the 2nd month and finally 1 in the 3rd month. From the 4th month onward, no additional energy will be attainable in the new realm from this arrangement.
