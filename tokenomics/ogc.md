### **OGC Earning Mechanics**

#### **Level requirement**

OGC earning is only available to Sneakers that reaches to Level 20.



#### **Rule of Three Requirement**

It is a mandatory requirement to have AT LEAST three Energy in order to start earning OGC.



#### **Halving Mechanics**

Each day, a set number of OGC will be unlocked to earn. The daily release of OGC follows exponential decay pattern, on the first day of the 3rd year, the daily OGC unlocked is exactly halved compared to the 1st day of OGC been available to earn.



#### **Einstein Mechanics**

The system constantly adds randomness to Users’ OGC earning, which makes earning unpredictable. To avoid any extrapolation on earnings, the settlement of OGC will be done in every several mins.



#### **Bitcoin Mechanic**

The OGC earning per person are pro rata based just like the difficulty bomb in Bitcoin and Ethereum design but **settles instantly.** The more users earning OGC at a given time, the less OGC earning will be available per person. Vice Versa.



#### **Comfort Mechanics**

The more Comfort, the higher the earning. OGC earning formula will be released once the earning is enabled in the app.

**Schadenfreude Pools**

Schadenfreude Pools are the pools that users can subscribe to, in order to burn OGC and permanently earn return from other misfortune moments, such as:

1. Receiving a lower quality Sneaker from higher quality Shoebox
2. Unsuccessful upgrade Gems.

Please note:

1. OGC return comes from taking a small % tax from all users’ OGC burning from Shoe-Minting or Gem upgrades.
2. The Schadenfreude Pools will have different varieties. Each variety of pools will correspond to a sneaker quality — hence five varieties of pools correspond to Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic and Legendary sneaker qualities. Each variety of pool will share the same % tax.
3. The smaller the size of the pool, the lesser OGC it takes to fill the pool. Once the lower sized pools are filled, the higher sized pool will be opened to subscribe.
